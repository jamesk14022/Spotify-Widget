Useage 

- Unzip the archive and place the Spotify-Widget folder into your wp-content/plugins directory
- Activate the Spotify Widget plugin and navigates to Settings->Spotify Widget and sign into your spotify account. This
will grant the widget an authorisation code to access the tracks you have listened to most recently.
- Insert a [spotify] shortcode where you wish to see the widget. It's as simple as that. See here for more 
information on how to use shortcodes.
