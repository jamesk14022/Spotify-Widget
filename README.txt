Usage 

- Unzip the archive and place the Spotify-Widget folder into your wp-content/plugins directory
- Activate the Spotify Widget plugin and navigates to Settings->Spotify Widget and sign into your spotify account. This
will grant the widget an authorisation code to access the tracks you have listened to most recently.
- Insert a [spotify] shortcode where you wish to see the widget. It's as simple as that. See here for more 
information on how to use shortcodes. https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/

Notes

- it is important that your spotiy client is not set to private listenting mode. This widget cannot access your 
private listening history.
- If you are facing some kind of bug, please deactivate and reactivate the plugin before seeking support - this can help solve a wide array of database related issues.
